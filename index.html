    <h1>Factorio Resource Generation</h1>
    <h2>or, "Why does choosing large ore patches result in so many small patches?"</h2>
    <p>
      I occasionally see folks lamenting that they got some small ore
      patches even though they asked the game to generate large
      ones. The Factorio wiki
      does <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/World_generator#Resource_and_terrain_generation">try
      to answer</a> this question, but I think an interactive
      explanation would help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the folks at Wube are talking about how they're going
      to change the map generator in version 0.17, much of this demo
      is going to become obsolete. To prevent that I'll mention the
      improvements they'll be using below.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this demo I've copied a lot from Amit Patel's interactive
      demos on <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">Red Blob
      Games</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Make some noise</h2>
    <div id="noise">
      <p>
        The first step is to draw a wiggly line using random
        numbers. We use something called a "noise function" to do
        this. A noise function takes some random numbers and uses them
        to draw a curve that has nice aesthetic properties. Of course
        it would be simpler to draw the random numbers directly, but
        the result wouldn't be very pleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many types of noise functions. This webpage uses a
        classic function
        called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin
        noise</a>; Factorio probably uses something similar.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <p>
        In a computer program such as Factorio, or such as this
        webpage, we can call the noise function like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote><code>function height(x) {
  noise(x);
}</code></blockquote>
      <p>
        This function is called once for every x coordinate on this
        graph, and returns the height that the graph should have at
        that point. Factorio obviously uses 2D noise that is based on
        both the x and y coordinates, but everything else will be the
        same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm leaving out many details about how the noise is created,
        and what parameters a game developer can use to customize the
        overall look of the noise. These parameters are fairly
        complicated, and can be used to turn a simple noise function
        into a wide variety of pleasing shapes and patterns. With some
        work, they can reproduce wood grain, the flocking patterns of
        birds, fire and smoke, terrain elevation, stock prices, or
        virtually any other thing you can think of. Part of the
        artistry of writing a game like Factorio is using noise
        functions effectively. For the purposes of this demo, I've
        kept the noise function fairly simple.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Threshold it</h2>
    <div id="threshold">
      <p>
        The next step is to treat the height of the curve as the
        amount of ore in that spot. Since the amount of ore in a tile
        cannot be negative, we treat all negative numbers as zero
        ore. This effectively clips the curve at zero.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <p>
        This is not something that Factorio will show you, but for
        demonstration purposes we'll keep showing the negative values
        so that you can see how they are modified by the later steps.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Pause and consider</h2>
    <div id="pause">
      <p>
        Let's look specifically at some of the ore patches that we've
        generated.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <p class="half left small-patch">
        This ore patch is fairly small, and has a single central peak
        where the density of ore is highest. This is the most common
        form that ore patches take.
      </p>
      <p class="half right large-patch">
        This one, on the other hand, is very wide, and has several
        peaks instead of just one.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Stretch it</h2>
    <div id="frequency">
      <p>
        The first option Factorio gives you is control over the
        frequency of ore patches. Higher frequency means that there is
        less distance between patches, lower frequency means a longer
        distance between patches.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you scrub back and forth below, watch how this also affects
        the width of each patch. At higher frequencies, the patches
        can become quite narrow, but some wide patches may still
        exist. At low frequencies each patch will be much wider than
        normal, but some will still be quite narrow.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <blockquote><code>function height(x) {
  noise(x * <span data-name="frequency"></span>);
}</code></blockquote>
      <p>
        Here we see how this is implemented. By multiplying the x
        coordinate by the frequency, we step further along the noise
        function for each step we take in the x direction. This
        squezes the noise function into a smaller amount of
        terrain. When the frequency is less than 1.0, this squeeze
        becomes a stretch.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Add to it</h2>
    <div id="size">
      <p>
        The next option Factorio gives is the size of the
        patches. This is intended to control the width of the patches
        without changing the distance between them. However, as you
        scrub the size value below, notice how new patches can appear
        between the existing ones. The existing patches have gotten
        larger, but these new patches will be smaller.
        </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <blockquote><code class="half">function height(x) {
  noise(x) + <span data-name="size"></span>;
}</code></blockquote>
      <p class="new-patch half right">
        A wild patch appears!
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from the implementation, all we're doing is
        adding a constant value at every point along the graph. This
        has the effect of raising or lowering the graph as a
        whole. This is much clearer when the whole graph is visible,
        as you can see ahead of time where the next peak will rise
        above the threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll also notice that the threshold starts out
        negative. This to make ore rare enough to make a fun game. If
        the offset were zero, then about half the map would be ore.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scale it</h2>
    <div id="richness">
      <p>
        Finally, Factorio gives us control over the richness of each
        patch. This is implemented by multiplying each ore amount by a
        constant factor, exagerating the peaks. However, even this can
        create new patches between existing ones, as peaks that were
        beneath the threshold are now pushed above it.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <blockquote><code class="half">function height(x) {
  <span data-name="richness"></span> * noise(x);
}</code></blockquote>
      <p class="new-patch half right">
        A wild patch appears!
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Seed it</h2>
    <div id="seed">
      <p>
        Of course it wouldn't be much fun if the ore was all in the
        same places every time you played. Thus Factorio chooses a
        random seed value when you start a new game, and arranges for
        each seed value to result in a different output from the noise
        function. Try some different seed values here to see this in
        action.
      </p>
      <svg viewport="0 0 660 220"></svg>
      <blockquote><code>set_seed(<span data-name="seed"></span>);</code></blockquote>
      <p>
        Factorio can use any of billions of different seed values, but
        for this demo I've limited them to just zero through 100. If
        you turn off clipping, you'll be able to see just how much the
        noise function changes shape with different seeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the "random" numbers used by the noise function depend
        on the seed value, you can start a Factorio map with a
        specific seed value and get the same map every time. This
        especially helps in multiplayer, as the server can send the
        seed value to each player and know that they will generate the
        same terrain as the server. Of course, anything the players
        build must still be communicated to all players, but the
        underlying terrain need not be. This can save considerable
        bandwidth during a game.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <div id="everything">
      <p>
        Of course Factorio doesn't make you pick just one of these
        four options; you can use them all simultaneously.
      </p>
